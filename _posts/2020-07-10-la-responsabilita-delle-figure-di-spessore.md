Sometimes I find myself stopping to think about issues that probably, actually definitely, don't need my involvement, and this happens at the most inopportune moments: while I'm talking to someone, while tidying up the house, when I'm washing the car with water flowing everywhere... you know, a whole story.

Recently, I spent several hours preparing a pot roast. Once it was ready, I sat down at the table, took my fork, and stared at the plate. Boom, my mind took off. I don't know if I drugged the plate, but I spent a good 15 minutes thinking about the responsibilities of prominent figures.

Prominent figures... these are people, or rather entities, who are above us with extraordinary responsibilities. Think of actors, singers, politicians. These are people whose words hold sway over a nation, thousands and thousands of people who see them as role models. People who cling to others' responsibilities with all their might.

Here we go, <mark>others' responsibilities</mark>. Take a politician, a man/woman who takes on the task of representing someone, of defending an ideal. How many responsibilities can a politician have?

Of course, the duties of someone in this profession are numerous. I would definitely go crazy in such a context. These are people who face the problems of a nation every day. During this period, COVID has given a lot to think about, and the weight of a nation under quarantine is certainly not easy to manage. Not to mention the post-quarantine period, with all the essential measures needed to maintain balance even after containing the virus.

Small and large businesses on the brink of failure, distraught families who are uncertain about their future. Those who don't see a future and those who have decided not to see it.

The problems are many, and responsibilities increase this year. We add this trend of seeing racism everywhere, and we find many more problems that, in turn, generate even more responsibilities. The job becomes increasingly difficult for these people.

Soon we will have to think about a plan for the repayment of borrowed funds to cover part of the damage caused by the pandemic. Added to this is the <mark>cause-effect of the Simplifications Decree</mark>, which will place even more responsibilities on these people, who will have to decide who will have access to these funds and which projects to invest in. It's not easy, it's all very complex.

I want to clarify that I am not a supporter of any party; I see politics as one big, fat comedy. I just stopped to think about how these people manage to live with this huge load of vital responsibilities on their shoulders, with the desperation of families on their conscience, and still find the time to present useless projects like the "Justice Decree." An unjust decree that seeks to do justice by trampling on human rights, freedom of expression, and thought, and digs in its heels when you change the channel on the TV.

Yes, in the meantime, the pot roast got cold, but it wasn't bad even reheated.

Peace and love.
