Racism is a problem that has plagued people for many years, I would dare to say forever. Black, yellow, white, blue, Lega Nord supporters, and so on. One way or another, we are all classified, if not by color, then by nationality, by hair, by religion, by political preference... there’s something for everyone.

Yet, it’s ironic to read about people standing against racism... seeing racism everywhere. The more I think about it, the more I laugh, the more I laugh, the more I cry. I mean, seriously.

Sometimes I stop to think: can I order a Negroni from a black bartender? But then, what does "of color" mean? Are we "whites" colorless? So should I feel offended, like I also want to be "of color"... but what about the Negroni?

We're at a point in history where, in an attempt to avoid racism, we end up being racist. To avoid showing someone that you noticed their color, their religion, or whatever, you make it noticeable: "excuse me, no offense, but I’d like a Negroni" :| and the bartender is like: "look at this idiot".

Okay, this was a bit of an exaggerated example. Out there, the situation isn't that bad... oh wait:

*   The terms master and slave in computing are considered racist
*   Blacklist and Whitelist are considered racist
*   In chess, white moves first, so chess is racist

No, seriously x.x just shoot me now, this world is a mess. Some people have neurons constantly fighting each other, surely no one will take action... [Twitter: We’re starting with a set of words we want to move away from using in favor of more inclusive language](https://twitter.com/TwitterEng/status/1278733305190342656?s=09).... [Canon Has Officially Dropped 'Master' and 'Slave' Terms](https://fstoppers.com/gear/canon-has-officially-dropped-master-and-slave-terms-497389) ..

And that’s it, COVID isn’t the only pandemic of the year, there’s a neuron storm coming.

Seriously now, speaking seriously. We are in 2020, after many years of fighting for rights, for equality, for mutual respect, perhaps it’s time to treat racism for what it is: a stupid topic that shouldn't even be considered because those who see racism everywhere are more racist than those who actually (in their ignorance) demonstrate it.

Pointing out every time that racism is everywhere only worsens the situation and creates increasingly complex wars, impossible to sustain, without winners or losers.

Peace and love.
