Yesterday we [released](https://vanillaos.org/2022/12/29/vanilla-os-22-10-kinetic.html) 
the first stable release of Vanilla OS (22.10 Kinetic). In this article I want 
to do some small reflections on how things are going. This article might seem 
premature given that not even 24 hours have passed since the release of the 
stable, but I think the first few hours are the most important to think about 
and make some considerations.

The release was a real success, people are using it and immediately understood 
the philosophy behind the project. Of course, bugs have already emerged that 
have escaped our months of testing but this is part of the game, we expected it, 
we knew it would have been impossible for such a young project to be able to 
see its first release without any bugs, when even the more famous and tested 
distributions have some. So, a hit, great!

The last month has been a lot of pressure and joy at the thought of finally 
showing everyone our progress. On the internet there was talk for months of how 
Vanilla OS would be a game changer, something revolutionary, unique, and the 
pressure was great. We have worked hard to meet these expectations and we hope 
we have succeeded.


## What happens now?
We have already started working on the bugs you reported to us and will release 
an update soon to fix them. At the moment these are not critical bugs, only 
minor ones which however affect part of the user experience and which must 
therefore be resolved as soon as possible.

I recommend logging into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3cD2Q7Ht3S) server to 
keep you informed.

## Vanilla OS 23.04
Work on the next release of Vanilla OS will start in a few weeks instead. We're 
taking some time to consolidate the 22.10 release and want to see how things go. 
We have tons of plans for the future and consolidation of Vanilla OS and we 
can't wait to tell you all about them.
