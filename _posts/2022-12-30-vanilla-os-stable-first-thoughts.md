Yesterday we [released](https://vanillaos.org/2022/12/29/vanilla-os-22-10-kinetic.html)
the first stable release of Vanilla OS (22.10 Kinetic). In this article I want
to do some small reflections on how things are going. This article might seem
premature given that not even 24 hours have passed since the release of the
stable, but I think the first few hours are the most important to think about
and make some considerations.

The release was a real success, people are using it and immediately understood
the philosophy behind the project. Of course, bugs have already emerged that
have escaped our months of testing but this is part of the game, we expected it,
we knew it would have been impossible for such a young project to be able to
see its first release without any bugs, when even the more famous and tested
distributions have some. So, a hit, great!

The last month has been a lot of pressure and joy at the thought of finally
showing everyone our progress. On the internet there was talk for months of how
Vanilla OS would be a game changer, something revolutionary, unique, and the
pressure was great. We have worked hard to meet these expectations and we hope
we have succeeded.

## What happens now?

We have already started working on the bugs you reported to us and will release
an update soon to fix them. At the moment these are not critical bugs, only
minor ones which however affect part of the user experience and which must
therefore be resolved as soon as possible.

I recommend logging into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3cD2Q7Ht3S) server to 
keep you informed.

## Vanilla OS 23.04

Work on the next release of Vanilla OS will start in a few weeks instead. We're
taking some time to consolidate the 22.10 release and want to see how things go.
We have tons of plans for the future and consolidation of Vanilla OS and we
can't wait to tell you all about them.
