<h1>I'm Mirko B.</h1>
<article class="reveal">
    <p>Ciao, I'm a UI/UX designer and proud Linux user from Italy, born in '94.</p>
    <p>My story in the world of computing began when the first PC arrived at
        home, I was very young. I was shocked by this "magic" box,
        not so much because it showed images but because I could move the
        contents on this screen, not like on TV. I immediately understood that
        from that day on it was going to be part of my life in some way.</p>
    <p>I remember spending my time writing texts on the computer for my father.
        I learned the keyboard by heart after a very short time. I spent a lot
        of time taking care of the formatting of the text: colors, fonts (those
        few available).</p>
    <p>One day a family friend brings us a box containing a CD with Debian. My
        brother and I immediately tried to install it, this took a long time
        because we didn't really know what we were doing. I remember that was
        my first experience with a Linux distribution and with KDE. A short
        time later I installed Ubuntu 8.04 and started using it more often.</p>
    <p>A few years later I received my first personal PC with Windows XP, with
        which I created my first website.</p>
    <p>Over the years I have cultivated a lot my passion for design and user
        experience. With each job my passion for attention to detail grew,
        to the point that I could no longer work with existing frameworks,
        I found them heavy and vast. The interfaces were all the same for me,
        they all used the same frameworks, the same lines. I then started
        excluding them from my workflow, going back to working from scratch.
        This allowed me to break out of the box and create something new.</p>
    <p>Over the years I have curated the UX of the products of various
        companies. Since 2021 I have been dedicating myself to UI and UX for the
        products of fabricators.ltd, the company of which I am a partner
        together with Pietro, a dear friend of mine.</p>
    <p>I am a strong supporter of Open Source and in my spare time I work on
        personal projects and contribute to others.</p>
